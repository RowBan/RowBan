### Robert Eriksson

## About me
<p>I'm a 34 year old fellow living in Bergsjö, Nordanstig.<br>
Originally from Söderhamn but lived many years in Gävle and Uppsala.<br><br></p>

## Occupation
<p>Fulltime IT Specialist at Visma Software AB. Earlier Yilport Nordic AB.<br>
I have a strong passion for problemsolving in various forms, am not afraid of this AI revolution<br>
and hopefully I and everyone else will survive it with our jobs intact or enhanced job prospects.<br>
In my current job there's quite a bit of webdevelopment required. Although it's not my main area of responsibility.<br>
My main area of responsibility is in the networking and DNS side of things. But when I do get to do webdevelopment it's generally in<br>
PHP and SQL with a dash of CSS and JavaScript.<br><br>
I alsow worked 10 years as a nurse before getting into the IT business and other odd jobs here and there such as<br>
teaching, rehab for youths and such.<br><br>

## Interests
Greatly in love with travelling and would appreciate a job where remote work is possible but not mandatory.<br>
Also quite the gamer and into amateur astronomy. I can atleast point out the Andromeda galaxy in the sky.<br>
Terrible at keeping my plants alive and a heavy consumer of Pepsi Max.<br><br>
I've always had a great passion for learning anything technical. Did a lot of programming as a child<br>
but then highschool came around and fitting in became more important<br>. I never did lose my<br>
interest for it despite not properly picking it up until much much later.<br>
I kept my general interest for anything technological alive throughout though.</p>

## My repos
<p>Just practice repos with a few tiny and useful Python scripts here and there.</p>
